This is a space in the internet where I will post news, blogs or any information related to any games. Currently I will be focusing on one of my favorite game which is League of Legends.

# Objective
- Make a website from scratch using HTML5, CSS and vanilla JS

        and name of the writer
- Anything related to League of Legends that I find interesting like post-match information, trending topics on Reddit etc.
